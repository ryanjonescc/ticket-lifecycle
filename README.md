<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>
To create a ticket, users must access the ticket portal and log in if required. Inside the portal, they can submit a request by describing their IT-related issue. In this example, I have created a ticket showcasing the types of problems that might arise in a real-world setting. Tickets are created using a Help Topic, a brief summary of the issue, and a detailed description written in an email-like format.

<p>Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

In this example we are setting the priority level of the ticket. The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire portion of the business. We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician. In some ticketing system customers can set their own SLA plans.
